Full-stack app.
It's a simple web based application for managing renting apartments marketplace. The main idea
is making a simple admin panel for the marketplace with a list of available apartments and
minimal functionality around it. Users have the ability to create new
ads and remove,update existing.
The application consists of two parts: a backend part (Web API) and a frontend part (SPA).
